#A method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string.

# Set up a match counter variable
# Set up an index counter variable
# Define a method that will take two variables = a string and the given character we are looking for
# Iterate through each index of that string. For each iteration, add one to the index counter for each iteration
# If the given character matches with that index of the string, add 1 to the counter variable
# When the counter variable indicates 3 matches have occured, print the index variable
# If the counter variable doesn't reach 3, return nil
